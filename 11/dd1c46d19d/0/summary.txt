Yes, git worktrees work perfectly with Claude Code. Here's the summary:

## What are git worktrees?

They create isolated workspaces sharing the same repo — you can work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching.

## How to use them with Claude Code

**1. Create a worktree:**
```bash
git worktree add .worktrees/feature-name -b feature/feature-name
```

**2. Launch a new Claude Code session in that worktree:**
```bash
cd .worktrees/feature-name
claude
```

Each Claude Code session operates independently in its own worktree, so you can have parallel work happening without conflicts.

**3. Make sure the worktree directory is gitignored:**
```bash
echo ".worktrees/" >> .gitignore
```

**4. When done, clean up:**
```bash
git worktree remove .worktrees/feature-name
```

## Why this is useful

| Use case | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Parallel features | Work on auth in one terminal, UI in another |
| Plan execution | Isolate implementation from your main working tree |
| Testing risky changes | Experiment without touching your main checkout |
| Code review | Check out a PR branch without disrupting current work |

## Practical tips

- I have a built-in workflow for this — when you ask me to start feature work, just say "use a worktree" and I'll handle the setup (directory selection, gitignore verification, dependency install, baseline tests)
- Store worktrees in `.worktrees/` (project-local, hidden) or `~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/<project>/` (global)
- Always run your project's setup commands (`npm install`, `pip install`, etc.) in the new worktree since `node_modules`/venvs aren't shared
