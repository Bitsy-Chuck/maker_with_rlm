Now the plan will show like:

```
Plan created: 8 steps
  Reasoning: Simple plan to create a video...

  [0] check_available_video_generation_tools (action_step)
      task: Check what video generation tools are available on the system...
      tools: Bash | fallback: none
      inputs: none
      output: step_0_output -> {tools_available: list}
      next: 1

  [1] gather_user_video_requirements (action_step)
      task: Gather specific requirements for the video...
      tools: none | fallback: none
      inputs: step_0_output.tools_available
      output: step_1_output -> {requirements: string}
      next: 2

  [3] determine_video_generation_method (conditional_step)
      task: Decide which method to use based on available tools...
      tools: none | fallback: none
      inputs: step_0_output.tools_available
      output: step_3_output -> {next_step: int, reason: string}
      next: CONDITIONAL
  ...
```

Now you can see the full flow — inputs, outputs, routing, and where it breaks. Try it again.
