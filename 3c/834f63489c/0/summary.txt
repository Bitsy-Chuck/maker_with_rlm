244/244 passing. The changes:

- **`planner.py`** — Added `set_validation_feedback(errors)` method. When set, appends the error messages to the user prompt so the LLM knows what went wrong and can fix it. Feedback auto-clears after one use.
- **`orchestrator.py`** — On `ValidationFailed`, calls `self._planner.set_validation_feedback(event.errors)` before the next retry loop iteration.
- **Tests** — 3 new tests: feedback appears in prompt, feedback clears after use, orchestrator passes errors through.

Now on retries, the planner will see something like:

```
Your previous plan failed validation with these errors:
- Orphan steps not reachable from step 0: [4, 5, 6, 7]
- Final step 7 must have next_step_sequence_number=-1

Generate a corrected plan that fixes these issues.
```
